# Singularity Python
Welcome to the Singularity Python documentation!

**under development** 

This code base is still being developed!

## What is Singularity Python
Singularity Python is a python client to work with the <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a> open source software. You likely will be most interested in the ability to interact with Singularity containers from within python, and your own Python scripts.

## Getting Started
 - [Installation](/singularity-cli/install): to your system with the python package manager pip, or use the client in a container that we provide.
 - [Python Shell Commands](/singularity-cli/commands): Learn how to interact with Singularity using functions from the spython module.
 - [Client Commands](/singularity-cli/client): spython also provides command line utilities to help with Singularity usage.


## Getting Help
This is an open source project. Please contribute to the package, or post feedback and questions as <a href="https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-cli" target="_blank">issues</a>.

## Contributing
We welcome any kind of contribution, whether a suggestion, a bug fix, feature request, or new feature. See our  [contributing docs](/singularity-cli/contribute-docs) for more information.
