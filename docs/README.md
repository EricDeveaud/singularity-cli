# Singularity Python
Welcome to the Singularity Python documentation!


## What is Singularity Python
Singularity Python is a Python API to work with the <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a> open source software. Are you a scientist or developer? You likely will be most interested in the ability to interact with Singularity containers from your own Python scripts. See <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/api/source/spython.main.base.html" target="_blank">here</a> for the core module docstrings.


## Getting Started

 - [Installation](/singularity-cli/install): to your system with the python package manager pip, or use the client in a container that we provide.
 - [Commands](/singularity-cli/commands): Learn how to interact with Singularity using functions from the spython module.
 - [Developers](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-cli/api/source/spython.main.html): The readthedocs documentation for the Singularity Python API.
